Kuchipudi is a classical Indian dance form originating from the village of Kuchipudi in Andhra Pradesh, evolving from a tradition of village-to-village dance-dramas known as Bhagavata Halo. The 17th-century Vaishnava poet Siddhendra Yogi formalized this dance-drama tradition, drawing from the Natya Shastra and creating classic works like Bhama Kalapam. Originally performed by male Brahmin troupes, the dance form became prominent with royal patronage and later saw the introduction of solo performances and female participation in the 20th century.
